# Active Learning for Rare Class
## Details

This code accompanies the AL strategies used in the paper [Transfer and Active Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare Class Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02459). The five AL methods: Random, Entropy, CoreSet, Contrastive Active Learning and Probability-of-Rare-Class are implemented independent of the datasets used.
